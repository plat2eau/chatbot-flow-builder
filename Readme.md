## Chatbot Flow Builder

#### Introduction

This is a simple demonstration of a chat-bot flow builder using the library reactflow.

Concept of Nodes and Edges is used to build a chat-bot flow with the Nodes representing the user messages and nodes representing the flow.
It is important to note that we have the functionality of defining new nodes that can be helpful to curate different and specific use cases.

We are using:
1. TS as a programming language
2. React JS library for UI
3. SCSS to style our components
4. Webpack for bundling the modules
5. Flow for type protection system
6. Support for Tailwind for scaling our CSS needs
7. SemanticUI for quickly getting components at hand
8. Babel for enabling support for latest Javascript version
9. Github as a versioning system
10. Github pages for hosting the app
